# legalLangLLM

The program within this repo is the core framework for a python based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. This particular agent is created to parse, vectorize and store legal documents and with the aid of Llama3.1:latest LLM, provide contextual output on the basis of the legal documents. This particular framework is created as a jupyter file and the LLM in context is run locally. The program serves as the core for smartAI agent that can be used to serve as a legal assistant. The program uses Langchain library to manipulate the data and the ollama library to locally run the LLM.
